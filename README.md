# haskell-abstract-algeba-practice

## Installation

```bash
cabal init
``` 

```bash
cabal build
cabal run abstract-algeba
``` 

## Problems

### Sets

1. Assume you have a proper definition for integers. Create a well-defined set of rational numbers.

Express this: `Q = { a / b : a ∈ Z, b ∈ Z, b ≠ 0 }` in Haskell

```bash
cabal run definition-of-set
```

### Subsets

2. Define the subset relationship between integers, rational numbers, real numbers, and complex numbers.


Integers and Rational Numbers:
- Integers are a subset of rational numbers.
- All integers can be represented as rational numbers where the denominator is 1.

Rational Numbers and Real Numbers:
- Rational numbers are a subset of real numbers.
- Real numbers include both rational numbers and irrational numbers.


Integers and Real Numbers:
- Integers are a subset of real numbers.
- All integers can be represented as real numbers.

Real Numbers and Complex Numbers:
- Real numbers are a subset of complex numbers.
- Complex numbers include both real numbers (where the imaginary part is zero) and purely imaginary numbers (where the real part is zero).

To visualize this relationship:

```
                       Complex Numbers
                            |
                       Real Numbers
                         /     \
         Rational Numbers       Irrational Numbers
              |
           Integers

```

- Complex numbers encompass all other number systems.
- Real numbers encompass rational numbers and irrational numbers.
- Rational numbers encompass integers.
- Integers are a subset of both rational numbers and real numbers.

In summary, the relationships among these number systems form a hierarchical structure where each system contains or overlaps with others, as described above.
